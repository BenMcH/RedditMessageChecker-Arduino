RedditMessageChecker-Arduino
============================

Checks to see if you have unread messages on reddit and activates a port on an arduino if you do.

This requires praw (For reddit) and pyserial (To interact with the serial port). Both of these can be installed with pip.

This was just a simple project to get me more familiar with python and the arduino.
